### React life cycle

Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases. The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.
Components are created (mounted on the DOM), grow by updating, and then die (unmount on DOM). This is referred to as a component lifecycle.

There are different lifecycle methods that React provides at different phases of a component’s life. React automatically calls the responsible method according to the phase in which the component is. 

#### Lifecycle Methods
A component’s lifecycle is broadly classified into four parts:

- initialization
- mounting
- updating, and
- unmounting.
