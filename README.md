### React life cycle

Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases. The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.
Components are created (mounted on the DOM), grow by updating, and then die (unmount on DOM). This is referred to as a component lifecycle.

There are different lifecycle methods that React provides at different phases of a component’s life. React automatically calls the responsible method according to the phase in which the component is. 


#### ***Lifecycle Methods***


A component’s lifecycle is broadly classified into four parts:

- initialization
- mounting
- updating, and
- unmounting.


***Initialization***

This is the phase in which the component is going to start its journey by setting up the state  and the props. This is usually done inside the constructor method.

```javascript
class Initialize extends React.Component {
    constructor(props)
    {
    // Calling the constructor of
    // Parent Class React.Component
    super(props);
    // initialization process
    this.state = {
       date : new Date(),
       clickedStatus: false
     };
} 

```

***Mounting***


The name is self-explanatory. Mounting is the phase in which our React component mounts on the DOM (i.e., is created and inserted into the DOM).
In this phase, our component renders the first time. The methods that are available in this phase are:

- componentWillMount()
-  componentDidMount()


***componentWillMount()***

This method is called just before a component mounts on the DOM or the render method is called. After this method, the component gets mounted.

***Note:***  You should not make API calls or any data changes using this.setstate in this method because it is called before the render method. 


***componentDidMount()***

This method is called after the component gets mounted on the DOM. Like componentWillMount, it is called once in a lifecycle. Before the execution of this method, the render method is called (i.e., we can access the DOM). We can make API calls and update the state with the API response.

```javascript
class LifeCycle extends React.Component {
  componentWillMount() {
      console.log('Component will mount!')
   }
  componentDidMount() {
      console.log('Component did mount!')
      this.getList();
   }
  getList=()=>{
   /*** method to make api call***
  }
  render() {
      return (
         <div>
            <h3>Hello mounting methods!</h3>
         </div>
      );
   }
}
```

***Updating***

This is the third phase through which our component passes. After the mounting phase where the component has been created,and inserted into DOM, the update phase comes into the scene. This is where component’s state changes and hence, re-rendering takes place.

In this phase, the data of the component (state & props) updates in response to user events like clicking, typing and so on. This results in the re-rendering of the component.
The methods that are available in this phase are:

- shouldComponentUpdate()
- componentWillUpdate()
- ComponentDidUpdate()


***shouldComponentUpdate()***

This method determines whether the component should be updated or not. By default, it returns true. But at some point, if you want to re-render the component on some condition, then ```shouldComponentUpdate``` method is the right place.

Suppose, for example, you want to only re-render your component when there is a change in prop — then utilize the power of this method. It receives arguments like nextProps and nextState which help us decide whether to re-render by doing a comparison with the current prop value.

***componentWillUpdate()***

Like other methods, its name is also self-explanatory. It is called before the re-rendering of the component takes place. It is called once after the ‘shouldComponentUpdate’ method. If you want to perform some calculation before re-rendering of the component and after updating the state and prop, then this is the best place to do it.

***ComponentDidUpdate()***

This method is called just after the re-rendering of the component. After the new (updated) component gets updated on the DOM, the ‘componentDidUpdate’ method is executed. This method receives arguments like prevProps and prevState.

Have a look to understand the updating methods better:

```javascript
class LifeCycle extends React.Component {
      constructor(props)
      {
        super(props);
         this.state = {
           date : new Date(),
           clickedStatus: false,
           list:[]
         };
      }
      componentWillMount() {
          console.log('Component will mount!')
       }
      componentDidMount() {
          console.log('Component did mount!')
          this.getList();
       }
      getList=()=>{
       /*** method to make api call***
       fetch('https://api.mydomain.com')
          .then(response => response.json())
          .then(data => this.setState({ list:data }));
      }
       shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState){
         return this.state.list!==nextState.list
        }
       componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
          console.log('Component will update!');
       }
       componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
          console.log('Component did update!')
       }
      render() {
          return (
             <div>
                <h3>Hello Mounting Lifecycle Methods!</h3>
             </div>
          );
       }
}
```
***Unmounting***

This is the last phase in the component’s lifecycle. As the name clearly suggests, the component gets unmounted from the DOM in this phase. The method that is available in this phase is:

***componentWillUnmount()***


This method is called before the unmounting of the component takes place. Before the removal of the component from the DOM, ‘componentWillUnMount’ executes. This method denotes the end of the component’s lifecycle.
Here isa flowchart representation of lifecycle methods:

### What is the Virtual DOM?

The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation.

React creates a virtual DOM. When state changes in a component it firstly runs a "diffing" algorithm, which identifies what has changed in the virtual DOM. The second step is reconciliation, where it updates the DOM with the results of the difference.

This Virtual DOM works in three simple steps.

- Whenever any underlying data changes, the entire UI is re-rendered in Virtual DOM representation.

- Then the difference between the previous DOM representation and the new one is calculated.

- Once the calculations are done, the real DOM will be updated with only the things that have actually changed.

### What are props in React?

Props are inputs to a React component. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to React Components on creation. They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component.

### What is Context API in ReactJS?

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language. Using context, we can avoid passing props through intermediate elements.


###  What are React Hooks?

Hooks are a new addition to React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

With Hooks, you can extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused. Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy


### What is JSX?
JSX is a shorthand for JavaScript XML. This is a type of file used by React which utilizes the expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax. This makes the HTML file really easy to understand.


### Why can’t browsers read JSX?

Browsers can only read JavaScript objects but JSX in not a regular JavaScript object. Thus to enable a browser to read JSX, first, we need to transform JSX file into a JavaScript object using JSX transformers like Babel and then pass it to the browser.


### What is an event in React?

In React, events are the triggered reactions to specific actions like mouse hover, mouse click, key press, etc. Handling these events are similar to handling events in DOM elements. 

### How do you create an event in React?

```javascript
class Display extends React.Component({    
    show(evt) {
        // code   
    },   
    render() {      
        // Render the div with an onClick prop (value is a function)        
        return (            
           
<div onClick={this.show}>Click Me!</div>
 
        );    
    }
});
```


### What is the significance of keys in React?
Keys are used for identifying unique Virtual DOM Elements with their corresponding data driving the UI. 
These keys must be a unique number or string, using which React just reorders the elements instead of re-rendering them. This leads to increase in application’s performance.

### What is Redux?
Redux is one of the most trending libraries for front-end development in today’s marketplace. It is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications and is used for the entire applications state management.


### What are the three principles that Redux follows?

- ***Single source of truth***:  The state of the entire application is stored in an object/ state tree within a single store. The single state tree makes it easier to keep track of changes over time and debug or inspect the application.


- ***State is read-only***: The only way to change the state is to trigger an action. An action is a plain JS object describing the change. Just like state is the minimal representation of data, the action is the minimal representation of the change to that data.


- ***Changes are made with pure functions***: In order to specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you need pure functions. Pure functions are those whose return value depends solely on the values of their arguments.



### List down the components of Redux.
Redux is composed of the following components:

- ***Action*** –  It’s an object that describes what happened.
- ***Reducer*** –  It is a place to determine how the state will change.
- ***Store*** – State/ Object tree of the entire application is saved in the Store.
- ***View*** – Simply displays the data provided by the Store.


### Show how the data flows through Redux?


![redux](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52384251/224524649-5c11c7ab-f4d2-4086-9926-4ae6ad6e4d79.png)


### How are Actions defined in Redux?

Actions in React must have a type property that indicates the type of ACTION being performed.
In Redux, actions are created using the functions called Action Creators. 

### Explain the role of Reducer.
Reducers are pure functions which specify how the application’s state changes in response to an ACTION. Reducers work by taking in the previous state and action, and then it returns a new state.
It returns the previous state as it is, if no work needs to be done.

###  What is the significance of Store in Redux?
A store is a JavaScript object which can hold the application’s state and provide a few helper methods to access the state, dispatch actions and register listeners. The entire state/ object tree of an application is saved in a single store. As a result of this, Redux is very simple and predictable.



### What is React Router?
React Router is a powerful routing library built on top of React, which helps in adding new screens and flows to the application. This keeps the URL in sync with data that’s being displayed on the web page.


### Why do we need a Router in React?
A Router is used to define multiple routes and when a user types a specific URL, if this URL matches the path of any ‘route’ defined inside the router, then the user is redirected to that particular route.

### Controlled and uncontrolled components

In React, a controlled component is a component that has its state controlled by the parent component. The parent component passes the state as props to the controlled component and also handles any changes to the state via callback functions. The controlled component only renders the received props and does not have its own state.

An uncontrolled component, on the other hand, maintains its own internal state and updates it using DOM events. The component directly updates the DOM and does not rely on the parent component to pass and update the state.


### How do you handle routing in a React application?

In a React application, routing is typically handled using a library such as React Router. React Router allows you to define specific routes for different parts of your application and map them to specific components. When the user navigates to a specific route, the corresponding component is displayed on the page.

### Explain the difference between server-side rendering and client-side rendering in React.

In a React application, there are two main ways to render the components: server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR).

Server-side rendering (SSR) is when the initial render of a React application is done on the server. The server generates the HTML for the initial state of the application and sends it to the browser. When the JavaScript bundle loads, React takes over and the application continues to function as a SPA (Single-Page Application) on the client side.

Client-side rendering (CSR) is when the React application is rendered entirely in the browser, using JavaScript. The browser requests the JavaScript bundle from the server and then renders the components on the client side.

### What is the difference between a stateless component and a stateful component in React?

In React, a component can be either stateless or stateful. The main difference between the two is how they manage and update their data.

A stateless component, also known as a “dumb” or “presentational” component, is a component that does not maintain its own internal state. It receives data and callbacks through props (short for properties) and only renders the UI based on those props.

A stateful component, also known as a “smart” or “container” component, is a component that maintains its own internal state. It can handle internal state updates and side effects, and may also manage the state of other child components.
